Overview of the school district analysis: 
The purpose of this project is to analyze student funding and student test scores.

Results: Using bulleted lists and images of DataFrames as support, address the following questions.

The disctrict summary shows that the 75% of students passed math and 86% of students passed reading but only 65% of students passed both.

The school summary showed how much of the budget was alloted per student and per school. The average budget per student was lower in the top five schools than it was in the bottom five schools.

Repalcing the ninth grade scores with NaN did not change Thomas High averages by much.
Because replacing the scores did not change much the scores by school spending, size and type did not have a noticable change.

Summary: Even though my analysis did not change much, this analysis is great to show how each grade benifits from the spending and the impact of spending more or less to imporve test scores by grade.
